A lonely couple,
 who long for a child, live next to a large, extensive, high-walled subsistence garden,
  belonging to a sorceress.[a] The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with pregnancy, notices some rapunzel (meaning, either a 
  Campanula rapunculus (an edible salad green and root vegetable) or a Valerianella locusta (a salad green)) growing in the nearby garden and 
  longs for it.[5] She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. 
  Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, 
  she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. 
  As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, 
  allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born.[b] Desperate, he agrees.
